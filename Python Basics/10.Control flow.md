Control flow in Python refers to the order in which your program’s statements are executed. Python provides several constructs that let you dictate that order, allowing your programs to make decisions, repeat actions, and handle errors gracefully. Here’s an overview of the main control flow tools in Python:

---

## 1. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow your program to execute certain code only if a specific condition is met.

### **`if`, `elif`, and `else`**

- **`if`**: Executes a block of code if its condition is true.
- **`elif`**: (short for "else if") Checks another condition if the previous `if` (or `elif`) condition was false.
- **`else`**: Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions were true.

**Example:**

```python
age = 20

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age < 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior.")
```

---

## 2. Loops

Loops let you execute a block of code repeatedly.

### **`for` Loops**

`for` loops iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

**Example:**

```python
# Iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Iterate over a range of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### **`while` Loops**

`while` loops repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

**Example:**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1  # Make sure to change the condition!
```

---

## 3. Loop Control Statements

Within loops, you can use control statements to alter the normal flow.

### **`break`**

Exits the nearest enclosing loop immediately.

**Example:**

```python
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break  # Exit loop when num equals 5
    print(num)
```

### **`continue`**

Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

**Example:**

```python
for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(num)  # Only prints odd numbers
```

### **`pass`**

A null statement that is used as a placeholder. It does nothing and is useful where syntactically a statement is required.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # No action is taken when i equals 3
    print(i)
```

---

## 4. The `else` Clause with Loops

Python allows an `else` clause to be attached to `for` or `while` loops. The `else` block executes after the loop finishes normally (i.e., it did not encounter a `break`).

**Example:**

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop finished without interruption.")
```

If a `break` is encountered, the `else` block is skipped:

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop finished without interruption.")  # This won't execute
```

---

## 5. Exception Handling

Exception handling manages errors that occur during program execution. The `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks help control flow when errors arise.

### **`try` and `except`**

**Example:**

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

### **`finally`**

The `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred.

**Example:**

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error!")
finally:
    print("This is executed no matter what.")
```

### **`else` with try/except**

The `else` block runs if no exception occurs in the `try` block.

**Example:**

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error!")
else:
    print("Division successful, result is", result)
```

---

## Summary

- **Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)** allow decision making.
- **Loops (`for` and `while`)** enable repeated execution of code blocks.
- **Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)** let you manage the behavior of loops.
- **Exception handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`, `else`)** provides a way to gracefully handle errors.
- **Loop `else` clauses** execute after a loop completes normally.

Understanding and effectively using these control flow structures is key to writing clean, efficient, and readable Python code.

# Range Function
The `range()` function is a built-in Python function that is commonly used with `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers. It’s especially useful when you need to iterate a specific number of times. Here’s how you can use it:

---

## 1. Basic Usage

### **`range(stop)`**

When you pass a single argument to `range()`, it starts at 0 and goes up to, but does not include, the `stop` value.

**Example:**

```python
# Iterates from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

_Output:_

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

## 2. Specifying a Start Value

### **`range(start, stop)`**

You can specify a starting point by providing two arguments. The sequence starts at `start` and goes up to, but does not include, `stop`.

**Example:**

```python
# Iterates from 3 to 7
for i in range(3, 8):
    print(i)
```

_Output:_

```
3
4
5
6
7
```

---

## 3. Specifying a Step Value

### **`range(start, stop, step)`**

If you want to control the increment (or decrement) between numbers, you can add a third parameter called `step`.

**Example with a Positive Step:**

```python
# Iterates from 2 to 10, stepping by 2
for i in range(2, 11, 2):
    print(i)
```

_Output:_

```
2
4
6
8
10
```

**Example with a Negative Step:**

```python
# Iterates backwards from 10 down to 1
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
```

_Output:_

```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

---

## 4. How `range()` Works Internally

- **Lazy Evaluation**: `range()` returns a special range object, which is an immutable sequence type. It doesn’t generate all numbers at once; instead, it produces them on demand as you loop through it.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Because it doesn’t store the entire list of numbers in memory, it’s very efficient for large ranges.

---

## 5. Practical Example: Combining `range()` with `for` Loops

Here’s a complete example that demonstrates using `range()` within a `for` loop to perform a simple task, like printing the square of each number from 1 to 5:

```python
# Print the square of numbers from 1 to 5
for num in range(1, 6):
    print(f"The square of {num} is {num ** 2}")
```

_Output:_

```
The square of 1 is 1
The square of 2 is 4
The square of 3 is 9
The square of 4 is 16
The square of 5 is 25
```

---

By using `range()`, you can control exactly how many iterations a loop should perform, making it a powerful tool for creating loops that require a precise number of repetitions.
